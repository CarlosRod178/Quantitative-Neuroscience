In neuroscience, we can use this test in lots of different ways.

Here is a [borderline neuroscience example](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14992027.2016.1227481?journalCode=iija20) of the use of such a test.\n","\n","**An important note: when you calculate chi-square, make sure you use the number of observations and not the percentage/proportion!**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pmF7ZvxN7h9A"},"source":["## Example 1: Face selectivity"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jawqS-2-7pSe"},"source":["Imagine that you are recording in the region of the inferotemporal cortex that responds selectively to faces. You are testing whether these neurons are sensitive to handsome or non-handsome faces. For handsome faces, you present a stimulus that we will  call \"Yale\" and record neuronal activity from multiple presentations. For non-handsome faces, you present a different stimulus that we will arbitrarily call \"Josh\" and record neuronal activity multiple presentations. From these recordings, you calculate an index from the neuron's average firing rate that measures the neurons' selectivity for handsomeness: a value of 0 means that it responds equally well to Yale and Josh; a value of +1 means it only responds to handsome Yale; and a value of -1 means it responds only to non-handsome Josh. You calculate this index for all of your neurons (let's say 1000) and find the mean is 0.8  (assume you have enough neurons so that the distribution is ~ normal) and then conduct a t-test to see whether the mean of this distribution  is different from 0. If it is, you can conclude that, on average, inferotemporal neurons respond preferentially to handsome Yale. \n","\n","But, what if you wanted to say something about each neuron? That is, if you wanted to identify those neurons that seem particularly sensitive to handsome Yale. What if you could conduct an analysis to determine whether the index of each neuron was significant (p<0.05 that the index was different than 0)? Imagine that you did this and found that 90 of these neurons had significant index values (i.e., the null hypothesis that the mean is 0.5) is rejected and 10 did not.
