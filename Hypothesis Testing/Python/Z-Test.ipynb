For example, if you flip a coin 10 times, what is the probability that it will come up heads 0, 1, 2, ... 10 times? This test therefore has the same goal as the exact binomial test. The difference between the two tests is that the exact test is always appropriate but can be more difficult to calculate and use under a variety of conditions, whereas the Z-test is only appropriate for large samples but is often easier to calculate and use, including for both one-sample and two-sample tests. One-sample tests are used to determine the likelihood of a Null Hypothesis that specifies a particular value of the underlying probability, *p*, given the data that you obtained. Two-sample tests determine the likelihood of a Null Hypothesis that specifies a particular relationship between the probabilities of obtaining the data from each sample (typically $p_1 = p_2$), given the data that you obtained.\n","\n","To use this test in the context of the three-step SPP Strategy:\n","\n","1) Determine the appropriate test statistic. \n","\n","2) Determine the probability distributions of the statistic under the chance model, as determined by the Null Hypothesis. In this case, we assume that the number of successes is distributed according to the [binomial distribution](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q1KaEjkAzUKRFSLPQ0SFdqU_byc70Oi2?usp=sharing), given a Null Hypothesis about the value of p; i.e., $H_0: p=$a particular value.\n","\n","3) Compare the observed statistic to its distribution under the chance model to determine the strength of evidence, or *p*-value. That is, determine the probability of obtaining the measured value of *k* (or any value greater than or equal to *k*, or less than or equal to *k*, depending on the question you are asking), given the binomial distribution computed using the assumed value of *p* and the same value of n that was used in the experiment.
