As the number of studies that examine the conditions that give rise to these kinds of non-luminance-mediated changes in pupil size have grown, there has been a heightened interest in understanding the specific neural mechanisms that underlie them. One particular mechanism that has gained a great deal of attention is the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus that is the source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine to most of the brain. Many articles that describe measures of pupil changes interpret those changes in terms of LC activity.\n","\n","Interestingly, until recently it was possible to trace the basis for that claim to a single reference; e.g., \n","\n","- \"Finally, neurophysiological recordings in the monkey have indicated that tonic changes in pupil diameter closely track the time course of LC activity, and show the same relationship to behavioral performance as tonic LC activity (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005; Rajkowski, Kubiak, & Aston-Jones, 1993).\" ([Nieuwenhuis et al, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20557480/)\\).\n","\n","- \"As shown in Figure 7, pupil diameter correlates remarkably well with LC tonic activity in the monkey (Rajkowski et al. 1993)\" ([Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16022602/)\\).\n","\n","- \"Rajkowski, Kubiak, and Aston-Jones (1993), for example, found a strong correlation in monkeys between baseline pupil diameter and tonic LC firing rate over the course of 90 min of performance in a target-detection task.\" ([Jepma et al, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20666595/)\\).\n","\n","- \"Rajkowski et al. (1993) found that baseline pupil diameter (recorded at the onset of each trial of the experiment) closely tracked LC tonic discharge frequency. Figure 1 provides an illustration of this strong correlation between LC discharge frequency and pupil diameter.\" ([Gilzenrat et al, 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20498349/)\\).\n","\n","It turns out that the Rajkowski et al. (1993) reference was an SfN poster with the following figure, which is also reproduced in [Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16022602/):\n","\n","<div>\n","<img src=https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WlpFY0AUvYPPG7xFPP7zW1cnne__qY3S width=500\\>\n","<div>\n","\n","The two variables look correlated, but we do not know by how much, nor whether or not these particular samples were representative of a general relationship between pupil and LC. Dr. Sidd Joshi set out to answer these questions by measuring pupil diameter and neural activity in LC (and other brain regions) and quantifying the results, in some cases using Spearman's (partial) rank correlation coefficients.
