    "The learning objective is to gain insights into thinking about inference from a \"Frequentist\" versus a \"Bayesian\" perspective. In brief, because a Frequentist does not consider the probability of an event or state of the world or hypothesis, only their frequency of occurrance, it is not possible to ask questions of the form \"what is the probabilty that hypothesis x is true?\" Instead, one can only consider questions of the form, \"what is the probabilty that I would have obtained my data, given that hypothesis x is true?\" In contrast, Bayesians consider the probabilities of such things (often called the strength of belief), but doing so can require making assumptions that can be difficult to prove.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Statistical significance from the Frequentist perspective is typically measured by comparing p to a threshold value; e.g., p<0.05. In this case, \"p\" is shorthand for \"the probabilty of obtaining the data under the Null Hypothesis\", so we are checking for: $$p(data\\,|\\,Null\\,Hypothesis) < 0.05$$\n",
    "Here we take the Null Hypothesis as \"not infected\", and the data are just the single positive test. Therefore, the relvant p-value is simply the false-positive rate: p=0.05, which is typically considered \"not significant.\" However, you can also see that it is not particularly informative."
