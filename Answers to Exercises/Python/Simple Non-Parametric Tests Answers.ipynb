What test would you use to compare median reaction times between geodes and limestone, and why?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Answer: Mann-Whitney U, which tests the (NULL) hypothesis that two unpaired samples come from distributions that have the same median value."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Scenario 2:\n","\n","You are a brilliant scientist working at a biotech firm developing a vaccine that reverses aging. Wow! To test the efficacy of the vaccine, you recruit 50 people, give them a course of your vaccine, and measure their age with a (very) special scale before and after treatment. You want to start by refuting the simple that that the participants' measured ages are not changed by the treatment.

To test your device, you present product X to a group of 40 individuals, and ask them to fill out a survery assessing how much they like the product (larger score means they like it more). Then, you have the individuals wear the device, present product X, and assess how much they like of the product. You want to know if the device reliably increases, decreases, or does not affect their liking of product X. What test would you use and why? What result would indicate that their liking has increased? "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Answer: Sign-test for the direction of effect.
