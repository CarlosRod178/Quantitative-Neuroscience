## Probability Distributions

The main objective of these lessons is to understand basic principles and properties of probability distributions. Please work through the lessons associated with common forms of parametric probability distributions and run the code there to get a more in-depth feel for how to work with probability distributions in your analysis code.

Those lessons include:

1) how to pseudo-randomly sample from probability distributions

2) how to generate theoretical distributions

3) using and identifying characteristics of several specific distribuions, including Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson, exponential, and normal (Gaussian)

4) comparing probability distribution functions (pdfs) and cumulative distribution functions (cdfs)

### Directory Structure

See each subdirectory for folders containing code in Python (mostly complete), Matlab (partially complete), and R (very incomplete).

All files can be downloaded to run on your local machine.
Python files all incude a button at the top to "Open in Colab" where the code can be run virtually
