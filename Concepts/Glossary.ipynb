Parameters are often denoted by [Greek letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet).\n","\n","**population**: The broad group of individuals/units that we wish to generalize our findings to.\n","\n","**population mean ($\\mu$)**: A parameter in the population. In frequentist statistics, the population mean is a fixed constant. For example, for the binomial distribution, $\\mu=n\\pi$.\n","\n","**population median (M)**: The value such that 50% of the values in the population lie/above below the population median.\n","\n","**population proportion ($\\pi$)**: The number of times an event/success occurs divided by the number of trials, sometimes thought of as the long-run average.\n","\n","**population standard deviation ($\\sigma$)**: A parameter in the population. Describes the spread in the distribution in the same units as the original values. For example, for the Binomial distribution, $\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\pi(1-\\pi)}$\n","\n","**population variance ($\\sigma^2$)**: Describes the spread in the distribution in the square of units used for the original values.\n","\n","**probabilities**: Numbers between 0 and 1 that describe the frequencies of the occurrence of possible values of a random variable.\n","\n","**probability distribution of a random variable**: For a categorical variable, the probability of each possible value of the outcome of the random variable. The sum of the probabilities for all possible values of the random variable is 1.0. For a continuous variable, the relatively probability (density) of each possible value; the integral of the density across all possible values of *X* is 1.0.\n","\n","**quantile**: Specific values that define the cumulative probability of lying below or at that value.\n","\n","**random sample**: A collection of experimental units selected in a way such that each of the individuals in the population has an equally likely chance of being selected into the sample.\n","\n","**random variable**: A variable that takes on different values in different samples. Often denoted by capital letters; e.g., *X*, *Y*. Also something we measure that can take on different values.\n","\n","**sample**: A collection of experimental individuals/units sampled in some way from the population of interest.\n","\n","**sample mean**: A statistic used to estimate the population mean.\n","\n","**sample proportion**: For the sample, number of times an event/success occurs, divided by the number of trials ($\\hat{\\pi}$, which sounds like \"pi-hat\"). Note that the sample proportion is also a sample mean.\n","\n","**sample size**: The number of experimental units in the sample.\n","\n","**skewed distribution**: An asymmetric distribution.\n","\n","**skewed left**: The tail of the distribution goes to the left (the more extreme observations occur on the left).\n","\n","**skewed right**: The tail of the distribution goes to the right (the more extreme observations occur on the left).\n","\n","**standard error (SE)**: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistical estimate.\n","\n","**statistic**: A mathematical function to summarize data and used to estimate the corresponding parameter in the population. For a particular dataset, the mean, the median, the largest value, the smallest value, the $25^{th}$ percentile, the $75^{th}$ percentile, the sample standard deviation, the sample variance, are all examples of statistics. In statistical notation, we use a variety of notations to indicate statistics; e.g., $\\hat{\\pi}$ for the sample proportion, $\\hat{X}$ for the sample mean, *s* for the sample standard deviation, *r* for the Pearson correlation coefficient).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tteEm2Qlgbb3"},"source":["# Credits\n","\n","Copyright 2021 by Joshua I.
